# Bar

Fork of [callahanrts](https://github.com/callahanrts) Bar widget with a few things changed for how I wanted it. I'm using as a system information bar with a small application launcher. 


Bar is an  [Übersicht](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht) widget
that places a customizable bar on your desktop.
